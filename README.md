# Purpose

This directory contains the code for the django app that runs on `r2lab.inria.fr` 

It used to be co-located as a subdir of a git repo simply named `r2lab` but that was growing too big, hence the split

It marginally depends on yet a third repo named `r2lab-raw` that comes with some static data, that were deemed too heavy to remain here.
