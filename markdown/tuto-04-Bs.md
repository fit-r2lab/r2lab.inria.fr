title: NEPI - File Exchange
tab: tutorial
---
<script type="text/javascript">loadMenu();</script>

Below are a couple of experiments as a second level of learning [NEPI](http://nepi.inria.fr/Install/WebHome) network tool and R2lab simulation testbed.

The experiments were made with an increment level from **B1** to **B2** to allow better subject understanding. Feel free to skip to the level that fits your knowledge.

From one experiment to other, like git style, we highlight the modifications, insert and delete actions by different colors to improve the user experience learning. In most of the experiments cases a picture explaining the scenario are presented to help the experiment comprehension.

Note that in these examples, differently from the previous experiments (A1-A4), we introduced two skills of NEPI. 

You will use **dependent** and **condition** NEPI instructions. Respectively lines **80/87** and **98/101/104/107**, highlighted in the code at **B1** experiment.

The dependent condition will install for us NC (netcat) tool prerequisites and the condition instruction will ensure that the **fit01** node will send the file only after **fit02** is done and listening on it.

  The experiment below uses four nodes. From your computer you will create and deploy <strong>local</strong>, <strong>gateway</strong>, <strong>fit01</strong> and <strong>fit02</strong> nodes. 
  <br/><br/>
  From <strong>local</strong> you will copy <code>file.txt</code> to R2lab <strong>gateway</strong> node, which in turn will copy the same file to <strong>fit02</strong> node. Both copies file will use <code>scp command</code>.
  <br/><br/>
  Once the file is present in <strong>fit02</strong> node, you will start <code>nc</code> (a.k.a. netcat) at <strong>fit01</strong> to listen in port 1234.
  After <strong>fit01</strong> starts listening in 1234 port, <strong>fit02</strong> node will transmit the file also using <code>nc</code>.
  The transmission from <strong>fit02</strong> to <strong>fit01</strong> use the wired <strong>control interface</strong>.
