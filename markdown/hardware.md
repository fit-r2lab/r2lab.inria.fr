        <b>Thirty-seven</b> nodes are available in R2lab to provide a modern testbed infra structure.
        The nodes are distributed in a grid layout and are customizable, allowing great variety of experimentation scenarios.

	The testbed is reservable as a whole.
	Once they have booked the testbed, registered users can ssh into `faraday.inria.fr`,
	and from there control all the resources in the testbed.
	You are thus in full control of all the radio traffic in the chamber.

        Also you can load your operating system of choice on any node.
	From that point you can ssh-access all nodes with administration privileges, and configure

### USRP nodes

Some nodes are equipped with USRP devices from <a href="http://www.ettus.com" target="_blank">ETTUS</a> to run SDR-based experiments such as spectrum analyzer or 4G/5G OpenAirInterface scenarios. All these devices can be remotely-controlled through the `ust`/`uon`/`uoff` utilities. 

Currently, our deployment features the following types of USRP devices :
  <a href="http://www.ettus.com/product/details/UB210-KIT" target="_blank">USRP B210</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ettus.com/product/details/UN210-KIT" target="_blank">USRP N210</a>, 
  <a href="http://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp2.html" target="_blank">USRP 2</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.ettus.com/product/details/USRPPKG" target="_blank">USRP 1</a> (see detailed mapping in the table below).

Make sure [to read the additional notes below](#gory-details) that cover some specifics of these devices.

###Lime SDR devices

Here are the detailed specifications for the LimeSDR devices deployed in the chamber (see table below for the details on which nodes host such devices)

*    **RF Transceiver**: Lime Microsystems LMS7002M MIMO FPRF (Datasheet)
*    **FPGA**: Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE40F23 - also compatible with EP4CE30F23
*    **Memory**: 256 MBytes DDR2 SDRAM
*    **Oscillator**: Rakon RPT7050A @30.72MHz (Datasheet)
*    **Continuous frequency range**: 100 kHz â€“ 3.8 GHz
*    **Bandwidth**: 61.44 MHz
*    **RF connection**: 10 U.FL connectors (6 RX, 4 TX)
*    **Power Output (CW)**: up to 10 dBm
*    **Multiplexing**: 2x2 MIMO
*    **Dimensions**: 100 mm x 60 mm
*    **Plus**: "What makes LimeSDR interesting is that it is using Snappy Ubuntu Core as a sort of app store. Developers can make code available, and end-users can easily download and install that code."

###Commercial 4G Phone

A Nexus 5 phone is available right inside the chamber:

* It is reachable through a Mac (that also sits in the room) that has
  its wireless card physically disabled, and that has a USB cable to
  the phone
* The Mac can be reached from the gateway as `ssh tester@macphone` (or
  the <code>macphone</code> convenience shell shortcut)
* Once logged in the Mac you can use convenience helpers to manage the
  phone (type <code>help</code> for details), or use <code>adb</code>
  manually.
* The mac can also be managed using apple screen sharing tools
  (VNC-compliant), pointing directly at <code>faraday.inria.fr</code>
* You will find more details about controlling the phone [in the
  tutorials section](/tuto-800-5g.md#PHONE).

###Important notes on SDR devices
<a name='gory-details'></a>
Please note the following specifics about the additional SDR devices:

* the following table shows in the **usrp** columns the type of the
  attached SDR, if present

* the `n210` and `usrp2` models use an **Ethernet** connection to link
  to the node. This means that on those nodes, the `data` wired
  interface is **not available**, as the hardware interface is wired
  into the USRP device.

    </div>
 
    <div class="col-md-8">

### Duplexers

Some USRP devices, like the `b210`, have their Tx and Rx SMA
connectors very close to one another. For that reason some have
a device named a **duplexer band 7**<a
href="/raw/docs/duplexer-band7-specifications.pdf"
target="_blank">[specs]</a> <a href="/raw/docs/duplexer-band7.png"
target="_blank">[pict]</a>.

The settings used in our deployed duplexers match the frequencies used
in our default configuration for OpenAirInterface. That is to say, it is assumed that

* Downlink (eNB to UE) uses frequency 2.66 GHz (duplexers are set to the 2.62-2.69 GHz range)
* Uplink (UE to eNB) uses frequency 2.54 GHz (duplexers are set to the 2.50-2.57 GHz range)

In the **duplexer** column below, devices are
tagged as either `none`, `for UE` or `for eNB`.

With the above assumptions, these tags can be interpreted as follows:

* `none`: no duplexer is attached

* `for UE`: to transmits on the uplink and receive on the downlink;  
  hence typically this setup can be used to scramble the uplink

* `for eNB`: conversely, this node is fit to scramble the downlink
