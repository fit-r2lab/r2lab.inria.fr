<strong>Important notes!</strong>

* R2lab platform is reset every time a <strong>nightly</strong> slice is found in the calendar,
which occurs a couple times a week on average.
As part of this verification routine, the testbed will be thoroughly reset and <strong>all data will be lost</strong>.
* In any case, please make sure to **save your experiment's data** once you are done,
as the next user will probably reload an image on your nodes.
* All times on this website are expressed wrt the <strong>CET timezone</strong>,
which is UTC+1 in winter, and UTC+2 in summer.

<div class="text-center" id="policy"><h2>Reservation policy</h2></div>

<p>The software does not enforce any limitation on the duration or frequency of reservations.<br/>
We expect however everyone to adhere to the following, common sense, rules: </p>

* Please do not reserve for more than 2 consecutive hours during daytime.
* When reserving in advance, please create a maximum of 2 slices for one given day.
* During the last half-hour of your reserved time, if there is no other reservation following the current slot, it is OK to extend for another 2 hours, and so on.
* Finally, if you are done early, then please just delete the current slot; the software will then automatically shrink your lease (so that we keep track, for accurate testbed usage statistics) so that the testbed becomes available to others.

Thanks !
