### What is R2Lab ?
<div class="row" markdown="1">
  <div class="col-md-6">  
  R2Lab is a Wi-fi mesh testbed infrastructure suitable for testing wireless devices and heterogeneous wireless communication.
  <br>
  <br>
	As part of a federation of independent experimental testbeds, provides a diverse and higher-performance platform for advanced Wi-fi experiments. The project priorizes scale and realism for supporting future wireless research.
	<br>
	<br>
	Through R2Lab testbed, located at INRIA Institute in Sophia-Antipolis - France, we offer a infrastructure with thirty-seven wireless nodes, offering highly flexible experimentation in a array of wireless network, allowing experimenters test in many ways the optimizations in radio frequencies for wireless applications.
	<br>
	<br>
	R2Lab as part of a Europe testbed project is partner of [OneLAb](http://www.onelab.eu/) based at UPMC in Paris and [PlanetLab Europe](http://www.planet-lab.eu/) federation which has servers connected to the core internet.

  <div class="col-md-7">
  <br>
  R2lab platform consists in a set of thirty-seven nodes in an anechoic chamber of **â‰ˆ 90m<sup>2</sup>** distributed in mesh layout to offer an advanced simulation wi-fi site.
  <br>
  <br>
  A full control of network nodes is provided with direct access to the gateway nodes. A full stack monitoring capability allow monitoring feedback from all network metrics like energy consumption, delay, throughput, overhead and etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides, NEPI tool ([see more](tools.md)) offers a quick experiments deployment and easy evaluation of results. NEPI offers the possibility of implement different simulation types, topologies and covering of a wide range of network real use cases.

### The OneLab platform
<div class="row" markdown="1">
  <div class="col-md-7">
  <br>
  R2Lab is also part of the OneLab project - a consortium of higher education and research institutions.
  <br>
  OneLab offers a variety of network communications environments and testbeds. OneLab provide a range of services: internet-overlaid testbeds; wireless, sensing and mobility testbeds; broadband access; core testbeds and network emulation environments.
