### What is R2Lab ?
<div class="row" markdown="1">
  <div class="col-md-6">  
R2lab is an open tested located in an anechoic chamber for reproducible research in wireless WiFi and 4G/5G networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
R2lab is [part of the FIT federation](https://www.fit-equipex.fr/testbeds), an open large-scale testing infrastructure for systems and applications on wireless and sensor communications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
Located at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, R2lab proposes thirty seven customisable commercial off-the-shelf wireless devices, together with USRP nodes and commercial LTE phones, fit to create rich experimental setups. The testbed also features advanced software like leverage GnuRadio and OpenAirterface, as well as efficient software tools, to support easy experimentation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
These tools allow to book the whole testbed, to remotely control the wireless devices, to easily deploy various scenarios and to collect results.

  R2lab platform consists in a set of thirty-seven nodes in an anechoic chamber of **â‰ˆ 90m<sup>2</sup>** distributed in mesh layout to offer an advanced simulation wi-fi site.
  <br>
  <br>
  A full control of network nodes is provided with direct access to the gateway nodes. A full stack monitoring capability allow monitoring feedback from all network metrics like energy consumption, delay, throughput, overhead and etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides, NEPI tool ([see more](tools.md)) offers a quick experiments deployment and easy evaluation of results. NEPI offers the possibility of implement different simulation types, topologies and covering of a wide range of network real use cases.

### The OneLab platform
<div class="row" markdown="1">
  <div class="col-md-8">
  <br>
  R2Lab is also part of the OneLab project - a consortium of higher education and research institutions.
  <br>
  OneLab offers a variety of network communications environments and testbeds. OneLab provide a range of services: internet-overlaid testbeds; wireless, sensing and mobility testbeds; broadband access; core testbeds and network emulation environments.
