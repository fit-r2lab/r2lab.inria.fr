# Angle of arrival

In this video, we give an end-to-end overview of how to conduct a realistic experiment. In this case, the scientific objectives are to compare the results of several methods for estimating the angle of arrival of a WiFi signal, on a receiver that has 3 aligned antennas, distant from one another by about half the wavelength.

This video emphasizes the usage of NEPI as a tool for designing the experiment logic. Check it out here&nbsp;:
