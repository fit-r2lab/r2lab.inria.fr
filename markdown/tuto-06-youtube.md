# Measuring WiFi angle of arrival

In this video, we give an end-to-end overview of how to conduct a realistic experiment. In this case, the scientific objectives are to compare the results of several methods for estimating the angle of arrival of a WiFi signal, on a receiver that has 3 aligned antennas, distant from one another by about half the wavelength.

This video emphasizes the usage of NEPI as a tool for designing the experiment logic. Check it out here&nbsp;:

# Taking a tour of the chamber using skype on top of a local 5G infrastructure based on OpenAirInterface

In this video, we illustrate how to leverage OpenAirInterface in order to

* create a standalone 5G infrastructure inside R2Lab,
* and deploy a base station on one of the nodes.

Based on this, we establish a skype session between a regular laptop and a commercial Nexus 6 phone, right inside the chamber, and take this chance to give a physical tour of the chamber.

Later on, we use yet another node as a scrambling device to terminate the call.
